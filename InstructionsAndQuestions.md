## Question 1: UTC Visitors in Malaysia 2013-2017
UTC (Urban Transformation Centre) is a one stop center for main government and private sector agencies services. Among the agencies’ services available at UTC include services from Immigration Department (Jabatan Imigresen), Road Transport Department (Jabatan Pengangkutan Jalan), Inland Revenue Board (Lembaga Hasil Dalam Negeri), National Registration Department (Jabatan Pendaftaran Negara) and many more.  

Download the [UTC visitor’s statistic from 2013-2017](http://www.data.gov.my/data/dataset/028b136e-fcbf-426f-9a52-2de2a21cfbef/resource/ce75b7bf-9740-45d1-b703-3372e7001cab/download/statistik-utc-negeri-mengikut-bulan-2013-2017.xlsx) .

Alternatively, the data can also be downloaded from uLearn. 

Calculate the sample means, median, mode, variances, standard deviation and draw a graph to summarize any features that draw a distinction between the visitor statistic between Perak, Melaka and Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur. Based on the summary, what can you conclude regarding difference of number of visitors between those states? You can use other information of the states to elaborate your conclusion.


## Question 2: Which Phone is the Best?
Select THREE hand phone brands (Samsung, Xiaomi, Apple). Then, find 60 students who have hand phones with these brands and observe the condition (surface) either excellent, good, bad. Show your observation in a table. Suppose a hand phone is selected at random. Find the following probabilities:
   
> a) P (phone "Samsung" and good)
> 
> b) P (bad and phone "Apple")
> 
> c) P (phone "Samsung" and "Apple")
> 
> d) P (phone "Xiaomi" or good)
> 
> e) P (excellent or phone "Xiaomi")
> 
> f) P (phone "Apple" or phone "Xiaomi")
> 
> g) Calculate the probability of the phone is good, given each of the brand that you have collected. 


## Question 3: Exam Result Analysis
Pick one member from your group. Select all of his/her past subjects with their grade. Please note that the grade is ‘rounded’ to the single letter only (e.g B minus or B plus is considered as B). If you randomly select nine subjects, what is the probability that:
   
> a) Four of the nine subjects get As?
> 
> b) Five of the nine subjects get Bs?
> 
> c) Three of the nine subjects get Cs?
> 
> d) One of the nine subjects get Ds?


## Question 4: Lunch Money
Collect data for the amount of lunch money spent per week from at least 60 students. 
>
> a) Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the collected data. Consider these as population’s parameter.
> 
> b) Find the highest 20% of lunch money amount.
> 
> c) There is a 30% chance of spending more than how much for lunches in a week?
> 
> d) What is the probability of spending for lunch within RM5 from the mean?


## Question 5: 
1.	You are required to collect data for more than 50 respondents for the survey provided. 
1.	Do the analysis of the survey which includes:  
    
    a) Demographic profile:  
    There are 6 items in demographic profile. Provide frequency, relative frequency, percentage  distribution table and as well as appropriate graphs for each item. Give some explanation  about each item.  

    b) Assume the data obtained are normally distributed.  
    Compare the means of every variable (financial awareness, parents influence, peer influence and self-control) between gender and engaging with part time by performing hypothesis testing between 2 means with the assumption of population standard deviations are unknown. 
    
    c) Assume the data obtained are normally distributed. Is there any reason to believe that the proportion of engaging with part time is higher? 

    d)	Assume the data are normally distributed. By taking saving attitude as dependent variable, run a simple linear regression by using:  
      > i) Financial Awareness
      > 
      > ii) Parents influence 
      >
      > iii) Peer influence 
      >
      > iv) Self-control

    as independent variables. Construct a simple linear regression equation for every independent variable. Which of these independent variables affect most towards saving attitude?

    e) Find linear correlation coefficient between dependent variables (saving attitude) and each independent variables (financial awareness, parents influence, peer influence and self-control). Make your conclusion. 

    f) Assume the data obtained are normally distributed. Compare the means of every variable (financial awareness, parents influence, peer influence and self-control) between age, faculties, financial methods, allowance they get by performing analysis of variance.  

1. Provide a report for the survey which include analysis as in (2). You can refer to the attached example of report. You may use as template for your report.  Based on the hypotheses done in (2), provide your own explanation why you reach a certain decision. You may refer to other sources in the internet and cite them for explanation. Please provide references as in the example of report. 

1. Detected plagiarism will be penalized.
